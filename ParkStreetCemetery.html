Paranormal activities like shadows moving, cameras dysfunctioning or capturing eerie images and health deteriorating have been witnessed in this place. People staying nearby are so afraid of this haunted place that they keep their windows shut at all times.

                <br>2.Located in the Park Street area in Kolkata which is known for its pubs and food joints, this cemetery was one of the largest non-church Christian cemeteries outside Europe and America. Today, it is no longer in use and is a heritage site. The tombs are done up in gothic and Indo-Saracenic styles and there are about 1600 of them in the cemetery. The memorials too are known for their imposing architecture replete with sculptures and fine details. People flock here to see the beauty of this place and observe the epitaphs of people gone by. It makes for a beautiful capture for a photographer. Even though the cemetery holds a historical importance and is visited by many every day, it is believed to be haunted too.

Some have been spooked later after a visit here. There are others who haven’t felt anything but those who have experienced something strange cannot shake off the eerie feeling.
