			<p>It is quite common for us to click photographs whenever we visit a tourist spot in the city. So did a group of friends who visited the cemetery but that was followed by a really strange occurrence. A group of healthy friends suddenly fell ill and one of them even had an asthma attack.  This famous tourist spot in the city is the oldest one among all the burial grounds in Kolkata built in 1767, and also the spookiest one. Paranormal activities like shadows moving, cameras dysfunctioning or capturing eerie images and health deteriorating have been witnessed in this place. People staying nearby are so afraid of this haunted place that they keep their windows shut at all times.</p>

			<p >This one is yet another haunted place in Kolkata which you must surely visit if you aren’t a faint-hearted person. There is a rumour that one could hear the footsteps of a person, supposedly Warren Hastings, who come to the place in search of his folder. That folder contained some old papers that could have saved him from getting impeached in London.  Presently it’s the Women’s College of Calcutta University. Some students claim that they have seen a man riding a horse visit the place.</p>

				 House of Dolls
			</h2></a>
			<p >Putulbari or the “House of Dolls” is situated near the Sovabazar jetty, not far from the haunted Nimtala Ghat. Now, the very thought of dolls in old houses with cobwebs and noises build an eerie feeling within us, isn’t it? There are some inhabitants in the house till now, but no one dares to visit the upper stories of this haunted house. If you are seeking for some paranormal adventure in Kolkata, you may surely try visiting Putulbari. The huge architecture of Roman style along with some dolls on stands just multiplies the spookiness of the place and will immediately give you jitters when you see it. The Babus (wealthy owners) who inhabited the place in the old days used to sexually exploit young women here and even killed some of them. Now it is said that the spirits of the women are still haunting the place in order to seek justice. Deep in the night, one may sense a shrill laughter or even clinking of bangles and anklets! Isn’t this just too scary to hear?</p>

			<p >There is a spot just under the Howrah Bridge which is near the Mullick Ghat flower market which is believed to be center for various paranormal activities in Kolkata. The wrestlers who practice in that area on a daily basis claim that they see flailing hands in the river and they are not sure whether those hands are of human beings or some spirits playing tricks with them.  People believe that there are the <b>spirits of those people who lost their life in the Ganges-</b> either by committing suicide or by drowning. Some people also recall the incident of witnessing a lady in white, sobbing and calling their name in a nasal tone which lure them into a state of trauma or to their deaths.

				Lower Circular Road Cemetery
			</h2></a>
			<p >The South Park Street Cemetery is not the only haunted cemetery in Kolkata. The Lower Circular Road Cemetery is also known for paranormal activities. The story about this place goes like there was a Civil Servant in the British Era, Sir William Hay MacNaghten, who was killed brutally during the first Anglo-Afghan War. His body was ripped apart and it was his wife who visited Afghanistan, assembled the leftover parts of his body, returned to Kolkata and buried it here in the Lower Circular Road Cemetery. In case anyone narrates his story near his grave, the huge tree above the grave starts shivering.</p>

                </h2></a>
			<p>If you pass the race course on the moonlit nights, especially on Saturdays, you might see “Shaheb er Shada Ghora” galloping over the stands. The story dates back to the 1930s when there was a race maniac named George Williams. He loved his horses more than he loved his job and family and his favourite one was a pearl white horse named Pride. She was known as the Queen of the Tracks and she won many races, fame and prizes for her master. But with age, she was fading and her last race was the Annual Calcutta Derby. Pride lost the race and George Williams lost his fortune. The next morning, she was found dead on the tracks and it is supposed that the spirit of this horse can still be seen now. As this spooky story made the rounds, the Royal Calcutta Turf Club earned an infamous reputation as a haunted place in Kolkata.</p>

			</h2></a>
			<p >The Nimtala Burning Ghat is <b>one of the oldest burning ghats in Kolkata</b> and is also considered to be one of the most haunted places in Kolkata.  It is believed that on the night of the Kali Puja, the <b>aghoris</b>come to the ghat for their various rites and to invoke the Shamshaan Kali, who is believed to be their reigning deity. The locals believe that the name must not be said out loud. They feed on the leftover flesh of the burnt bodies and use this ritual to generate occult powers in themselves. These occult rites and gory sacrifices have rendered the Nimtala Burning Ghat.</p>

			<p >No one works here after sunset! You ask why? The most powerful building of Kolkata is also one of the most haunted places in Kolkata. The Writer’s Building used to house the secretariat building of the state government of West Bengal. The empty rooms in this 300 year old building have some hidden secrets. Story has it that this building has been haunted for many decades and the caretakers staying here could not continue their job for more than one month. This was the place where famous revolutionaries Binay, Badal and Dinesh killed Captain Simpson of the East India Company. The large rooms in the building are said to be inhabited by the ghosts and someone’s shrieks are heard late at night even though the building is deserted after 7 pm.</p>

			<p >Suicide in Kolkata Metro has been a common thing of late, but it is quite weird that 80% of the suicides of all suicides in the City of Joy (ironically) take place at Rabindra Sarovar Metro Station. Although it is one of the busiest metro stations, it can be termed as the “Paradise of Suicide”. The last train is said to be haunted and people have seen eerie shadows and weird images moving and then disappearing in the gust of wind. Even some of the station attendants and train drivers have said that they have seen figures walking around aimlessly. Take the last train, and Calcuttans say that you won't see a single living soul at this haunted station when the train pulls out of the station./p>

			</h2></a>
			<p >The Wipro Office is one of those haunted places in Kolkata whose stories you'll hear young people narrate, rather than the older generation. It is now that Salt Lake has become the IT hub of Kolkata, but once upon a time it was a part of the Kolkata wetlands. The office of Wipro is supposed to be built on a graveyard and the local residents of that place claim that they have seen strange visions in the darkest hours during the night. People are strictly advised not to wander in the Third Floor of the Tower 3 and the floor is shut all most all the time as it is haunted by many ghosts. People working the graveyard shifts in this office have often complained of hearing and seeing things whenever they leave to use the lifts or step out of the buildings.</p>
