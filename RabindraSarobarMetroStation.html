               If you are looking for chills and thrills while in Kolkata; getting them might be as easy as taking the last tube train to Ravindra Sarovar Metro Station. This metro station is a magnet for suicides and according to reports; paranormal activity at this subway stop is palpable during late hours.
                <br><br><br>
                The <b>Rabindra Sarovar Metro station</b> is one of the busiest stations (plus, one of the top haunted places) in our city, with hundreds of people pouring in on a daily basis. Unfortunately, it has earned a bad name as a <b>‘suicide point’</b> and is accountable for around 50% of the total suicides in the city. Pretty shocking, isn’t it? As a consequence, the station is haunted by restless spirits that grimly lurk out of the shadows. While it’s considered to be safe during most of the day, the late night trains are almost empty as people prefer to keep away from the possibility of unpleasant encounters. Till this date, many Kolkatans choose to avoid the Rabindra Sarovar Metro Station with it being firmly established as one of the most haunted places in Kolkata.</p>

                The souls of people who had committed suicide are seen on the metro station platform at late hours.Peculiar shadows on the platform pillars or passing the tracks are common. Quite scary among the most haunted places in Kolkata.
                <br><br><br>
                The last train is believed to be haunted and people have seen spooky shadows and felt an eerie presence around them. Train drivers and station attendants have also reported of seeing shadowy figures walking on the train lines. This is the sole reason why living souls tend to avoid the last train passing through this station.
