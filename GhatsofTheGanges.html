            There is a spot just under the Howrah Bridge which is near the Mullick Ghat flower market which is believed to be center for various paranormal activities in Kolkata. The wrestlers who practice in that area on a daily basis claim that they see flailing hands in the river and they are not sure whether those hands are of human beings or some spirits playing tricks with them.  People believe that there are the <strong>spirits of those people who lost their life in the Ganges</strong> either by committing suicide or by drowning. Some people also recall the incident of witnessing a lady in white, sobbing and calling their name in a nasal tone which lure them into a state of trauma or to their deaths. You try to save the apparitions, you might end up losing your life!<br></p>
